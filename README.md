# Sound Source Classification Using LEAF
## Overview
This project aims to decode the complex relationships between urban soundscapes and perceived human wellbeing by leveraging IoT-based acoustic data. We use advanced sound classification techniques, including LEAF (Learning with Efficient Audio Features) and traditional Mel-Frequency analysis, to map urban acoustic profiles and link these soundscapes with subjective human responses. This research will help evaluate how urban noise influences feelings of wellbeing, security, and community engagement.
